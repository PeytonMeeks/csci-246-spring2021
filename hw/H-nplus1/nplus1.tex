\maketitle

This homework assignment should be
submitted as a single PDF file to Gradescope.

Write a two-page paper describing to me how you have grown as a student,
computer scientist, mathematician, engineer, or a researcher in this class, and
more generally, in this semester.  To support your argument, you should include
your homework or writing samples (or excerpts from them) in an appendix as
evidence (and reference them!)

If you do not feel that you've grown, explain why.

Remember, style counts. Use complete sentences.

This HW will be graded on the following scale:
\begin{itemize}
    \item No submission (-1 point)
    \item Low pass (+1 point)
    \item Pass (+3 points)
    \item High Pass (+5 points)
\end{itemize}
