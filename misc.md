# Miscellaneous Assignments

Throughout this semester, you will have the opportunity to attend various seminars or events, and write a brief reflection on them for credit in the miscellaneous category. These reflections should be written as a formal two-page paper. In general, you may consider the following questions when writing your reflection, but there are no specific formatting requirements (unless otherwise stated):

* What did you learn?
* Were there any algorithms involved? (Even if not explicitly discussed).
* What is a piece of advise that you took away?
* Did an audience member ask a question that you particularly liked or disliked?
* Is there a question that you wish you could have asked but didn't?
* If related to the event, what were you thinking about as you were leaving?
* Did this event inspire you to look something up after the event? If so, what was it?
* Did you meet someone new at this event who you could see as a mentor / mentee / collaborator in the future?
* What is your take-away message from this event?

## Without Specific Dates

Each of the following assingments is due one week after the event.

1. Attend one of the CS seminars. They are held Mondays 16:10-17:00.  Please
   join cs-announce the notification of who is speaking each week (and the WebEx
   link).
2. Attend a writing workshop.  They are held on Fridays, 9:00-10:00 (please see
   discord for the link, or ask Prof. Fasy).  When you join, please bring a
   short writing sample (something that can be read in 5-10 minutes).  A great
   example of something to bring is the write-up of one of your homework
   problems.  (Of course, if you bring your HW, you should note the
   collaborators in the header of the HW itself). We use breakout rooms to break
   into groups of size 2-3, spend some time reading our partner's writing
   sample, then some time giving feedback to each other.  In the end, we come
   back as a group and discuss any themes that emerged.  To earn miscellaneous
   credit, you should make the suggested edits to your writing sample and submit
   the original version, submitted version, and a one-half to one-page write-up
   explaining what you learned about technical writing from this experience.
3. Escape room.
